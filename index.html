	<div class="box1">SCIENCE
		<p>One of the major benefits that Science students have over Arts and Commerce students is that they are eligible for almost all Science as well as non-Science career options. That is why, after passing 10+2 in Science, course selection at UG level becomes a major turning point to give direction to one's career. Thus, it must be an informed decision with a good understanding of the course and career one is opting for.</p>
